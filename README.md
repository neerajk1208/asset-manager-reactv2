(In progress) Recreated a basic asset manager application using React

# Languages/Libraries/Frameworks used: 

JavaScript, React, D3, Bootstrap, CSS

# User Flow

![Alt tag](http://g.recordit.co/ozPdAYmlln.gif)
User selects a risk profile - a number from 1 - 10. 
User then inputs details regarding his/her current portfolio standings. This is a breakdown of 5 asset categories: 
 
  1. Bonds
  2. Stocks
  3. ETFs
  4. Real Estate
  5. Cash

Based on these inputs, asset-manager will generate the following: 

  1. A list of how assets should ideally be divided based on input risk profile. 
  2. List of recommendations for how user can adjust current portfolio to ideal asset allocations (to mimic the doughnut chart)
